# Pemex Analysis

Welcome!

This repo contains **all my code efforts** to properly document my undergrad thesis results and make sure they're replicable.

In my thesis, I estimate the **effect that oil prices have on the drilling and production decisions of Mexico's national oil company: Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX).**

All production data comes from Mexico's oil & gas regulator, the National Hidrocarbons Commission (CNH in spanish).

# Access to data

Here's links to the data used in this project. It's all public access data, collected from the Mexican federal oil & gas commission (CNH).
