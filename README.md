# Pemex Analysis

Welcome!

This repo contains **all my code efforts** to properly document my undergrad thesis results and make sure they're replicable.

In my thesis, I estimate the **effect that oil prices have on the drilling and production decisions of Mexico's national oil company: Petr√≥leos Mexicanos (PEMEX).**

All production data comes from Mexico's oil & gas regulator, the National Hidrocarbons Commission (CNH in spanish).
