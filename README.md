# Pemex Analysis

Welcome!

This repository contains **all my code efforts** to properly document my undergrad thesis results and make sure they're replicable.

In my thesis, I estimate the **effect that oil prices have on the drilling and production decisions of Mexico's national oil company: Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX).**

# Access to data

Oil production and drilling data comes from the **Hidrocarbons Information System (_Sistema de Información de Hidrocarburos_, SIH)**, a public access repository managed by the (now extinct) Mexican oil & gas regulator: the **National Hydrocarbons Commission (_Comisión Nacional de Hidrocarburos_, CNH).** 

Given 2024 administrative and regulatory reestructuring at the federal level, these agencies no longer exist as independent entities and, unfortunately, access to this data is intermitent and/or unavailable.

Since it's all public access data, feel free to download it from my personal backup files:
